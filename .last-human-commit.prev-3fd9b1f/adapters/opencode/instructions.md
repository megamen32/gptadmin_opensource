# OpenCode adapter instructions

Native profiles are Markdown files under the configured OpenCode agents
directory. The installed profile must contain the complete role prompt at
startup; it must not spend a turn reading `src/common/agents/<Role>.md`.

Before every child call, load `templates/subagent.md` for the fresh-context,
Task Card, and cheapest-sufficient model rules.

Keep the core role unchanged. This adapter owns profile frontmatter, native
permissions, and any harness-specific resume/session metadata. When a rendered
role lazily names a companion profile or protocol relative to its role file,
resolve that path from the installed canonical role source; the role body stays
embedded and is never read again at runtime.

Before L sends its final answer, run the core `SELF_IMPROVE.md` protocol and
persist its compact record.
