# Claude Code adapter instructions

Use the Claude Code surface's native role/profile mechanism when one is
configured. Otherwise the marker-preserving `CLAUDE.md` block is the portable
fallback. The adapter must keep the complete role context in the child prompt
and must not overwrite project-owned text outside the marker pair.

Before every child call, load `templates/subagent.md` for the native context,
Task Card, and cheapest-sufficient model rules.

Do not promise scheduled resume until the active Claude surface exposes and
verifies its cron or scheduled-task transport.

Before L sends its final answer, run the core `SELF_IMPROVE.md` protocol and
persist its compact record.
